                <p>Tracing the lives of multiple aspects of my identity through characterization, personal myth, and performance.</p>

                <p>The GIRL traverses the realms of language and landscape to find herself.
                  The BIRD, first conceived in <a href="Page - NFL.html" title="Nautilus free lossy">NAUTILUS FREE LOSSY (2018)</a>, wanders around an otherworldly landscape, 
                  glimpsed through the quilted hole of a textile screen.
                  The PICTURE MAKER holds court. She stands at the center, pouring drink for those who approach her.</p>
          
                <p>As written about by Anne S. Rogers:</p>
                <p>"The Picture Maker has trapped the image of the Bird in her world, 
                  constraining its roaming to a small space that is only one stop on the journey towards the reward that she promises.</p>
                <p>Fu describes the Bird as being eager to experience the world, as free, as present in the space they occupy. 
                  The Picture Maker, however, is putting on appearances. The Picture Maker is spatially trapped by the table that surrounds 
                  herâ€”it allows her to lure people in with the promise of a sweet drink, and maintains her presence as a certain image, 
                  but it also restricts her movement, and her ability to interact with the world. She cannot experience the freedom of 
                  movement that the Bird has when she is in this role. This brings up questions about how we behave 
                  when we're fully present in the world and unconcerned with how others perceive us, as compared to when we're
                  focused on creating appearances that will influence how we're remembered in the future."</p>
