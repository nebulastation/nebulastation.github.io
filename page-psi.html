                <p>Pleione Shall I? was a spatial play in three acts. It was developed and performed at Ox-Bow with the guidance of 
                <a href="http://paulajwilson.com/" title="Paula Wilson">Paula Wilson</a>.</p>
                <p>Act I was a welded steel spiral structure with a fabric piece and audio recording.
                <br><br>Act II was a live reading of the same text between two trees.
                <br><br>Act III was a rock circle, where participants discussed what had just transpired. 
                    A painted portrait of a woman's face, a guardian spirit, accompanied each act.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Pleione shall I shoulder your skin?
                <br>Tooth sore and aching marrow
                <br>too many, too long have your eyes been open
                <br>the bee in sweetwater alight with its stinger
                <br>
                <br>Plea, a plea to no days without
                <br>Go ‘round to return but I never remembered
                <br>the agelong promise, that Mobius strip
                <br>there again backwards, here now once more
                <br>
                <br>Pleione, please, a moment too narrow
                <br>I’ve squeezed my great thighs and purged the foul smoke
                <br>like your words cut oh so cuttingly close
                <br>and split into shards for the light to bemoan
                <br>
                <br>To ride with me follow me into the core
                <br>though the way is shaded, thorned
                <br>silver glow bent at orthogonal angles
                <br>a lattice – no body – they sigh they throw roses
                <br>
                <br>What better? What better? No one for eternity!
                <br>but Pleione my dear for them trees do not grow
                <br>Follow me follow me to drink by good groves
                <br>Drink by good groves and mumbling green
                <br>
                <br>A cord woven tight, a ladder sans increment
                <br>falls to us here for we’ve been here before
                <br>and never have rootbearers called out so sharply
                <br>nor nerves thrown fire scarlet into gaping holes
                <br>
                <br>A lift, some give, a push, no a pull
                <br>Pleione Pleione care for the edges!
                <br>turned rough turned rough were smooth long ago
                <br>for your whistling waters had formed a shelf, a floor
                <br>
                <br>Now high falls lie desiccate, stretched to far bounds
                <br>and lambs grown and quartered to be swallowed up whole
                <br>to have knotted them together and reoriented toward home
                <br>the task would have been a good one, no?
                <br>
                <br>Resuming our search, our palms cupped still empty
                <br>We sing to medley gods and cradle dark portions
                <br>Pleione, you’re weary, I’ve read the inscriptions
                <br>and decoded the thirty-ruled cloth you abhor
                <br>
                <br>If one comes and one comes and one comes then none
                <br>And if one comes but one comes and none shows then one
                <br>We bartered for affections most beautiful toils
                <br>but your salts accumulated row upon row
                <br>
                <br>Merope, Sterope, true faith hath befallen
                <br>the crowns of your root beds now float up to sow
                <br>to pluck, to crease, you worried a storm
                <br>and all of that time I was here taking note
                <br>
                <br>A turnip so fleetingly drawn up to sow
                <br>A turnip so fleetingly drawn up to sow
                <br>Your beds selling noontimes and no times for sorrows
                <br>I’ve written you loveliness for morrows for bone</p>
