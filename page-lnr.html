                <p>Solo exhibition at FiveMyles
                <br>558 St. Johns Pl. Brooklyn, NY
                <br>Jan. 4 - Feb. 16, 2020</p>
                <br>
                <p>Step into a room with long scroll weavings, ceramic sculptures resembling plants, a painted house, 
                  and headphones inviting you to listen.</p>
                <p>A boundless love finds shelter in a pattern, and freedom in breaking from it. 
                  The music and woven scrolls in Lover / no reason embody time spent with 
                  software and mechanical machines to establish stable structures. 
                  A looping bar of percussion and repeat of 99 steps in a weaving pattern coexist
                  in this world of sensation.</p>
                <p>And yet the mind wanders, following the fluttering heart - one slip and there may be a landslide. 
                  The bar that loses its grip on the grid, or the weaver whose feet disobey. Venturing into the expanse of 
                  decision-making feels like layers of forks in the road.
                  To recover a kind of shelter in impending disorder is the sensual squashing of muck into a vase or tower of cups. 
                  A house found abandoned on the side of the road, rediscovered as a site for visual pleasures.
                  My songs to you, not polished nor gentle, but rather a push-pull in my understanding of what it is to love.</p>

                <p>In response, by Erik Wangsvick: "There is a space made between the light and the circle painting 
                  on the floor. Upon entering this tube within a cube, there was a prompt to put headphones. I did 
                  and wondered what I was supposed to hear. It became like a listening to a sea shell experience. 
                  I wondered if the muffled sound of traffic outside is a music I'm supposed to hear. The sound 
                  of my fingers against the headphones gave me an idea for a music experiment of my own.</p>
                <p>I leave and as I'm skating on the street I continue to think about the exhibition as a whole. 
                  Some shows work as a collection of individual pieces but this does not feel like that. 
                  I started making sense of the show as a collection of acquaintances. They share some knowing of 
                  each other. They share a strange space and are trying to be comfortable, though, each one is most 
                  comfortable being itself. They gather awkwardly because they is virtue in breaking from an insular 
                  existence and a gathering has been called for."</p>
