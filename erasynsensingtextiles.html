                    Collaborator Anna Routson and I develop a system for designing and producing garments using data recorded from the everyday life
                     of the wearer. After generating initial designs based on answers to personal questions, we create subsequent design instances by 
                     inputting volume, light, and accelerometer data captured from wearable sensor boards into a textile design algorithm. The outputs 
                     of the algorithm are weave files that are then hand woven on a TC2 Jacquard loom and constructed into seasonal garments. The 
                     relationship of garment to wearer inspires its long-term use as a uniform, in turn encouraging decreased consumption of fast fashion 
                     garments and textiles. By enacting the life conditions of the wearer as variables impacting textile design, the distinction between 
                     consumer and designer transforms into a collaborative relationship.

                    <p class="heading"><strong>Intro + objectives</strong></p>
                        <br>
                    Garments are a person’s second skin. Material, structure, and shape coalesce, reflecting the wearer’s choices as a result of lifestyle, preferences, values, and surroundings. The data-assisted design system developed in this project makes this relationship explicit in the textile. As a person’s life conditions change, the textile design algorithm can output new instances of an initial design to reflect those changes.
                    The design system need not be limited in application to textiles and fashion, though we choose to focus on them in the scope of this project. The principles can be applied to any material and design process. The advantage of using a data-assisted design system is that the autonomy of the human being is preserved. Support structures of data analysis methodology and algorithmic data processing are built with the sensitivity of humanity in mind, carrying a critique of widespread data-harvesting and deterministic advertising practices.
                   <br><br> Through the synthesis of designer, data analyst, craftperson, wearer, and researcher roles, Anna and I present an alternative to the global fashion industry standard of creator-led fashion. Whereas prominent fashion houses today are largely led by artistic directors whose ideas determine the aesthetic outcomes of garments produced downstream, we envision a ground-up alternative that privileges the circumstances of the wearer and “recipient” of the design as the meaningful variables in the design outcome. 
                    Further, the garments produced as a result of the data-assisted design process are meant to be worn as uniforms; that is, repeatedly and for a long time. Because the textiles are handwoven using quality yarns, their craft and aesthetic value is high. In the landscape of mass-produced garments and fast fashion, these garments stand out not only for their design but also for their durability and beauty.

                    <br><br>The project objectives are: <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.	to apply a nascent design philosophy to one industry and mode of production, 
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.	to offer an alternative vision to the dominant narrative of garment design and production,
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.	to engage in an experimental and synergistic method of working with data and weaving technologies.
                   <br><br> The primary questions we pose are:
                   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.	How can art, design, and life be merged so that distinctions between designer, maker, and consumer dissolve? What does collaboration look like under these circumstances?
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.	How can data-assisted design processes catalyze people versed in traditional craft to develop forward-looking structures for design thinking? 
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.	Can data collection from individuals be made for poetic and liberating purposes? Can we humanize the use of data?
                    <br>The presentation of this project will consist of a multimedia exhibition of garments and textiles. Anna and I will wear the finished garments
                     in a live show that combines elements of a runway show, art exhibition, and choreographed performance. The research and development process can be 
                     shown in the form of digital design files on monitors, printed design files, video and audio recordings, stations where viewers can interact with 
                     the textile design algorithm code, and sensor board data collections demos. Programming in the form of interactive workshops where participants
                      develop their own data-assisted design systems for textiles and other materials could be organized. 
                   <br><br> The project will be open-source: all files and documentation will be publicly accessible via cloud-based storage.

                    Phase 2<br>
                    We discussed the fundamental design from which to iterate, and concluded that as simple and intuitive an initial design process as we could achieve would be appropriate to the goals of 
                    the project. I asked Anna what her favorite flower is (tiger lily); mine is the bird of paradise. We found 1 image of each flower online and proceeded with file preparation for the TC2 Jacquard Loom.
                    The TC2 allows handweavers precise control over each intersection of warp and weft, and as such frees the designer from having to repeat steps or form any pattern in the design. Where plenty
                    of artists use the freedom afforded by the TC2 to create image-based handweavings, Anna and I are much more curious about the potential of the TC2, in partnership with the human, to create iterative,
                    living patterns that grow in sync with the maker/wearer's life experience. (This is the future of design).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Phase 3<br>
                    We began to design the Jacquard fabric. Anna had the idea to use one of the flower forms (tiger lily) as a container in the pattern, and the other (bird of paradise) as a texture or fill
                    inside the container. In this V0 design we are relying very much on intuitive skill developed over years of creative practice. How does this relate to the data-assisted design decisions
                    we will be making in future phases of this project?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lookahead<br>
                    22 December 2020: We are scheduled to use the TC2 Jacquard Loom at Praxis Fiber Workshop (Cleveland, OH) from January 8 - 17, 2021. We will finalize the V0 design by December 25 and then
                    proceed with data collection round 1, consisting of X days where we both wear the Circuit Playground Express-embedded undergarment. The data sets we will be collecting are: 1. position change in
                    along the Z axis and 2. sound (volume). The former is mapped to the total % of accent color woven into the Jacquard fabric of the wearer. The ratio of the latter between Anna and Connie will
                    modulate the relative size of container (tiger liy) pattern in the woven Jacquard fabric for each wearer. We will weave the fabric for the exoskeletons and construct them via sewing machine by 
                    Spring 2021. A second iteration is planned for the creation of a second capsule collection in F/W 2022.
