                    Collaborator Anna and I embarked on a project to upgrade the way we approach design. Anna, coming from a fashion and textiles background, and I, from one of fine art and sound design,
                    envision a series of garments tailor-made for the  wearer, that morph with the wearer according to their lifestyle over time. Using data collected from the ADafruit Circuit Playground Express,
                    and using simple analysis methods, we modulate a shared V0 textile design to create 2 individualized textiles that are variations of each other. The closeness of the design to the life
                    of the wearer (without being overbearing) results in a garment that is not only beautiful and well-crafted, but also a uniform that can be worn repeatedly in a stand against disposable fashion.

                    Phase 1<br>
                    We researched the market of sensors specialized for sensing textiles / e-textiles projects. We chose the Circuit Playground Express over the Arduino Lilypad and Adafruit FLORA due to its
                    inclusion of multiple sensors in-the-box. We ran tests to see what the nature of data captured from the board would be. Concurrently, we procured a pattern for a full-length next-to-the-skin
                    undergarment and obtained power mesh (chosen for its breathability and slight stretch) with which to construct the garment. We decided on a neck placement for the sensor board, as that would
                    allow for reliable contact with the skin as well as visibility in the overall look.
