                  Connie Fu is an interdisciplinary artist whose work brings sound, craft, and performance together to express metamorphosis, spiraling journeys, and twin loves for order and disorder. 
                  She is originally from Michigan and is fairly nomadic, calling many places home. She's interesed in supporting artists of all kinds in sustaining and nourishing their life and creative practice.
                   Connie's performance work has recently been presented at the Station Museum of Contemporary Art (Houston), Maelstrom Collaborative Arts (Cleveland), Cherry Street Pier (Philadelphia), 
                   and La MaMa Theatre (New York). Connie Fu is an interdisciplinary artist working primarily in textiles, sound, and performance.
