                    Connie Fu is an interdisciplinary artist working primarily in textiles, sound, and performance.
She combines techniques and materials to create multidimensional environments in which
narratives inspired by personal mythologies unfold. Objects are used as props and left as
artifacts of performance gestures. Recently, Connie performed The Chrysanthemumâ€™s Folly at
Cherry Street Pier in Philadelphia with collaborator Jungmok Yi. Her objects were recently
exhibited at FiveMyles in New York, Stay Home Gallery in Paris, Tennessee, and online at
Acogedor Space.

My work emerges from the interactions between multiple threads of inquiry (material, gesture,
and composition) applied to the fundamental issue of what it means to COMMUNICATE. I tackle
questions pertaining to how information travels from inside to outside, and vice versa, as well
as how that information gets repeated, distorted, modified, and shuffled about in our collective
efforts to understand. In my attempts to tackle these questions head-on, I inevitably end up
taking a circuitous route, visiting different formats and techniques of expression along the way.
I arrange the products of my inquiry and labor in performances that dance with narrative
potential and resist literal interpretation. Ultimately I hope to offer artistic experiences that
inspire openness in the minds of those who experience them.
