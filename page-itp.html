                <hr>
                <p>Interactive performance at Chautauqua School of Art
                <br>22 Hedding Ave. Chautauqua, NY
                <br>Aug. 5, 2019</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Infinite Tea Party is a gathering of friends and objects that never ends; instead, it manifests in a series of points in time and space.</p>
                <p>Handmade ceramic objects function as vessels for food and drink. All are welcome for open conversation. The tea party, long a ceremonial bastion of human life, is enacted in artful warmth.</p>
                <p>The first known instance of the Infinite Tea Party occurred at Chautauqua School of Art, near the end of a 7-week residency program. Over 40 artists and mentors came together during the program, and a great many dropped by the tea party to share in reflecting on what had transpired.</p>
