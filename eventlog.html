  <h4>April 12, 2021</h4>
  <p>In March and April I facilitated Creative Work Group, a monthly session hosted by Maelstrom Collaborative Arts. In the two sessions the participants and I took on roles of IMAGE SUMMONER, SOUND GENERATOR, and MOTION FORGER and performed 5-minute scenes with improvised material. 
    The goal of each session was to loosen up our creative faculties and remind ourselves of how unexpected connections can occur from seemingly disparate parts. <a href="https://maelstromcollaborativearts.org/">More about Maelstrom</a>.
